# Discord Timestamps

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that displays **Discord Timestamps** (eg. `<t:1734818400:D>`) in **reading mode** the way they would display in Discord.

There are no custom settings for this. As long as this plugin is **enabled**, it converts those timestamps throughout the entire note when viewing it in **reading mode**.
