# Discord Timestamps
This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) that displays **Discord Timestamps** (eg. `<t:1734818400:D>`) in **reading mode** the way they would display in Discord.

As long as this plugin is **enabled**, it converts those timestamps throughout the entire note when viewing it in **reading mode**. You can optionally disable converting timestamps in codeblocks under **Settings → Discord Timestamps → Convert code blocks**.

Just like in Discord, the timestamp will have a **colored background** to it. If you **hover** over the timestamp (on desktop) or **select** the timestamp (on mobile), the full date and time will be displayed.

There is also a **command** in the [Command palette](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Command+palette) as well as in the editor context menu to **insert a timestamp** when you are currently editing a note.
